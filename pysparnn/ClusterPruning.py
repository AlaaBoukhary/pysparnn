        Uses cluster pruning structure as defined in:
        http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/cluster-pruning-1.html

        tldr - searching for a document in an index of K documents is naievely
            O(K). However you can create a tree structure where the first level
            is O(sqrt(K)) and each of the leaves are also O(sqrt(K)).

            You randomly pick sqrt(K) items to be in the top level. Then for
            the K doccuments you assign it to the closest neighbor in the top
            level.

            This breaks up one O(K) search into two O(sqrt(K)) searches which
            is much much faster when K is big.
